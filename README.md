Clars√© Automotive

This is my first serious project, completed as part of the CSS module
in the The Odin Project curriculum.

I decided to make this my first public project, which I already consider
part of my portfolio. Because of that, I built the homepage based on my
own ideas, which took more time than the original task required.

Techical notes:
- The project is built using HTML and CSS only,
- I used Flexbox wherever it made sense and probably even where it didn't,
- The code structure and readability could definitely be improved, but I'm just
starting out and this is what I know for now.

What I learned:
- How to build a webpage from scratch,
- How to use Flexbox for layout,
- How to organize HTML and CSS into (clean) structure,
- The importance of planning and clean code

About the project:
I am quite happy with how it turned out.
This project showed me how much I still do not know - which is a
great thing. Now I have solid starting point for future learning and better project down the road.

Big thanks to The Odin Project community for the awesome learning
material and support. JavaScript here we go.
